CLASS NOTES ---

-- @NotNull -- The variable this is declared above cannot be null, widely used and very helpful.
-- @Size(min=1, max=100, message="error") -- The variable this is declared above cannot have a size less than 1 character (for a String) and greater than 100 characters and will have a messag eof "error" if not within those constraints. CAN USE A VARIABLE in place of the numbers.
-- @Valid -- Constraints defined on the object and its properties are be validated when the property, method parameter or method return type is validated. This is placed in the controller.

-- CHECK THE DOC FOR ERROR VALIDATIONS -- DEFINITELY DO THIS!!! https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/tutorials/2.1/thymeleafspring.html

-- ENUMS --
    -- An enum type is a special data type that enables for a variable to be a set of predefined constants.
    -- The variable must be equal to one of the values that have been predefined for it.
    -- Common examples include compass directions (values of NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, and WEST) and the days of the week.
    -- Enums can also store values!
    -- NOTE: enums, by convention, are ALL CAPS!

    -- ENUMS are great because --   
        -- Define a set of possible valid values
        -- Easier validation
        -- No string comparison!
        -- Can be used in switch statements!!
